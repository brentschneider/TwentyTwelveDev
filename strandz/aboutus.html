  <h2> Quincy McDonald</h2>
  <p> <strong>Owner / Stylist</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>Training:</strong> Mr. Leon&#39;s School of Hair Design 1991 / Redken Specialist Program 1996 / Advanced Extension Certification 2002.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> I opened Strandz in 2000. After working as a stylist for larger corporations, I felt the need to open a small intimate full service salon. I wanted to offer ethnic hair care services, as it was very difficult to find other salons in Spokane that did. Either the stylists were scared because of inexperience or the training simply wasn&rsquo;t offered.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> <em>&quot;Hair can be like a puzzle or riddle. I love to solve, put together, and unlock beauty of women who are looking for something new, and may not know what it is!&quot;</em> - Quincy</p>

  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Kristen enjoys working with each client and helping them understand their hair and how they can best work with it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Quincy has always been my biggest supporter and mentor. Working with Ethnic hair has always been a dream of mine and at Strandz I have been able to fulfill my dream and am getting better and better with every client. I started off my career in Coeur D&rsquo; Alene at Bling Salon but I soon found the fast paced salon was not my style. I enjoy sitting down with my clients and completing a consultation before enhancing my clients true beauty.</p>

  <p>Meet the newest stylist on our team. Madie comes to us from Paul Mitchell! She offers cuts, colors, extensions, waxing, and all of your beauty needs!</p>
  <p><em>&quot; Even though I'm the youngest stylist in the salon, I like to keep everyone laughing and always on their toes.  Looks can be decieving, people might call me "alternative" however I grew up listening to motown but appreciate all different genres. I take the same approach with hair as I do with music, there's not one style I favor over another I enjoy it all.</em></p>
